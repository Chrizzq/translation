Help Translate CodoMC!
======================
Our development team doesn't speak all the languages in the world, so that means we 
need your help! If you don't see your language help us add it, fork this repo and create 
the apropriate localization file with the proper language code and country code. Then 
copy over the en-US.lang into your new file called `languagecode-countrycode.lang`. Once 
you finish translating make sure to push and create a pull request to this repo 
we will find some way to screen it and make sure it is apropriate, then if it passes our 
tests we'll merge it into this repo and add it to our localization for our plugins.
